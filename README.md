This project was made to explore possible correlations between country results on the International Mathematical Olympiad and various factors. 
Currently, the only factor that I have researched is the distance between the host country and the researched country. 

The files starting with 'data' get the data from the official IMO website. They get data on both venue and results and join them into one data frame.
The files starting with 'function' create required functions. First, calculate the distance between two countries. Second, fetch one country results from the data frame. 
Lastly, the visualization file contains relevant visualizations: scatter and regression plots. 

Further improvement includes researching other factors (previous performance, education quality ranking) and running enhanced statistical tests.
